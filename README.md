## Usage

This app was built for loan officers in mind. The user is able to create multiple vehicles with associated customer names. 
Creating a loan is slightly different, you must associate a loan with a given vehicle. Thus you are able to create multiple 
vehicles with multiple loans. Because this app gives you a lot of freedom, make sure you stay organized. Customer names and loan category names 
are very important and they should be based on ease of association.
